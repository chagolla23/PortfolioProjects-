I visualize #insights on Airbnb data from 2016 in Tableau. 
In this #project I show listings by zip codes are that are most profitable,
average revenue by the number bedrooms and a line graph that displays the trend of demand throughout the 2016 year.
This was a fun project, impactful for those looking to invest in an AirBnB property.
